# Getting Started

The purpose of this library is to provide a type-safe encapsulation of operation results that may have succeeded or
failed, instead of throwing exceptions.

If you like `Optional` but feel that it sometimes falls too short, you'll love `Result`.

The best way to think of `Result` is as a super-powered version of `Optional`. The only difference is that whereas
`Optional` may contain a successful value or express the absence of a value, `Result` contains either a successful value
or a failure value that explains what went wrong.
