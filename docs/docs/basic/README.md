# ðŸª´ Basic Usage

Very often, all we want to do with a successful result is to execute a specific action with its value. On the other hand, if itâ€™s a failed result we may have some recovery strategy or alternative actions to take.

Other simple scenarios include checking whether the operation succeeded or unwrapping the success/failure values.
