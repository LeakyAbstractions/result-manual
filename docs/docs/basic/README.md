# ðŸª´ Basic Usage

In this section, we'll cover foundational use cases, including checking the status of a result, unwrapping the value inside a result, and taking different actions based on success or failure. These basics will help you handle errors more cleanly and efficiently without cluttering your code with _try-catch_ blocks.
