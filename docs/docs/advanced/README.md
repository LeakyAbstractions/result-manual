# ðŸš€ Advanced Usage

While understanding the basics (like checking status, unwrapping values, and executing conditional actions) provides a solid foundation, the true potential of result objects is unlocked through their functional capabilities. Mastering these techniques enables concise and readable error handling by leveraging the power of [monadic composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad\_\(functional\_programming\)).

{% hint style="success" %}
The most idiomatic approach to handling results involves screening them (with methods like `filter` or `recover`) and applying various mapping and flat-mapping methods to transform and compose behavior.

This section will guide you through these powerful tools, demonstrating how to manipulate results effectively so you can craft more robust and maintainable Java applications.
