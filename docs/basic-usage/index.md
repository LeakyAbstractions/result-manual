# Basic Usage

Very often, when we have a `Result` instance we want to execute a specific action on the underlying success value. On the other hand, if itâ€™s a failed result we may have some recovery strategy or alternative actions to take.

Other simple scenarios include simply checking whether or not the operation succeeded, and unwrapping the success/failure values.
