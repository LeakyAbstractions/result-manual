# Example Project

This is a Java project to build a [Micronaut-based](https://micronaut.io/), stand-alone _Pet Store_ server that uses `Result` objects internally.

It is based on [swagger-petstore](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore).

You can access the source code [here](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result-example).
