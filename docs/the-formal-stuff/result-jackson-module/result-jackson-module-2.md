# Conclusion

## Conclusion

We've shown how to use Result with Jackson without any problems by leveraging the [Jackson datatype module for Result](https://github.com/LeakyAbstractions/result-jackson/), demonstrating how it enables Jackson to treat instances of Result objects as an ordinary fields.

The implementation of these examples can be found [here](https://github.com/LeakyAbstractions/result-jackson/blob/main/lib-jackson/src/test/java/com/leakyabstractions/result/jackson/Example\_Test.java).
